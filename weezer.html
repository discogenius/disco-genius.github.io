            <h2>Discography Highlights</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weezer</strong> (1994) – The band's self-titled debut includes the hits "Buddy Holly", "Say It Ain't So", and "Undone - The Sweater Song". It is acclaimed as one of the greatest albums of its decade and of all time.</li>
                <li><strong>Pinkerton</strong> (1996) – Though received negatively upon release, Pinkerton has since been reappraised as an equal to its predecessor. The music is taken in a much rawer direction, and songs such as hit singles "The Good Life" and "El Scorcho" are somewhat more overtly melancholic than prior songs by the band.</li>
                <li><strong>Weezer</strong> (2001) – To distinguish it from their debut, Weezer's third album is typically known as the Green Album. Singles "Island in the Sun" and "Hash Pipe" charted in the top 30, with the former peaking at No. 19. The initial negative reception to Pinkerton led to the Green Album taking a much more polished pop-rock sound - however, since Pinkerton's reappraisal, its successor has often been written off as somewhat of a mistake.</li>
