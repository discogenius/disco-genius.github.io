                Billy Joel's level of success cannot be understated.
                A contemporary of musicians such as Bruce Springsteen, Elton John and Warren Zevon, the New York-based singer-songwriter has sold over 180 million records (placing him among the best-selling artists of all time) and had eight top 40 hits in the UK, including 1983 chart-topper "Uptown Girl" and 1993 top 3 hit "The River of Dreams".
