                Billy Joel's level of success cannot be understated.
                A contemporary of musicians such as Bruce Springsteen, Elton John and Warren Zevon, the New York-based singer-songwriter has sold over 180 million records (placing him among the best-selling artists of all time) and had eight top 40 hits in the UK, including 1983 chart-topper "Uptown Girl" and 1993 top 3 hit "The River of Dreams".

            <h2>Discography Highlights</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Turnstiles</strong> (1976) – Joel's fourth effort, though not an initial commercial success, places among his greatest works, with songs such as "Summer, Highland Falls", "New York State of Mind" and progressive-pop masterpiece "Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)" being fan favourites and live staples.</li>
                <li><strong>The Stranger</strong> (1977) – Joel's beloved fifth album is considered among the greatest ever made - its nine-song tracklist includes such hits as "Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)", "Only the Good Die Young" and "Just the Way You Are", as well as Joel's through-composed magnum opus "Scenes from an Italian Restaurant".</li>
                <li><strong>Glass Houses</strong> (1980) – On this album, Joel takes overt influence from such legendary figures as Elvis Costello and XTC - the mix of this angular new-wave sound with Joel's Beatlesque songwriting skill makes it patently clear why Glass Houses (featuring hit singles "You May Be Right", "Sometimes a Fantasy" and "It's Still Rock and Roll to Me", as well as fan-favourites "All for Leyna" and "Sleeping with the Televsion On") is such a remarkable success.</li>
